# Reverse String in C++

This repository contains a simple C++ program that demonstrates how to reverse a C-style string without using any standard library functions. The program dynamically allocates memory for the reversed string and prints both the original and reversed strings.

## Functionality

- **reverseString**: A function that takes a C-style string as a parameter and performs the following tasks:
  - Determines the length of the input string without using any standard library functions.
  - Creates a new dynamically allocated character array to store the reversed string.
  - Reverses the characters of the input string and stores the result in the dynamically allocated array.
  - Prints both the original and reversed strings.

## Example Usage

The `main` function contains an example usage of the `reverseString` function, which processes the string `"practice"`:
